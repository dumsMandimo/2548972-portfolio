            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Duma, and I am completing my final year of my BSc degree.
                During my free time I enjoy rowing at VLC with my friends from the rowing club, going to the gym,
                running, hiking, reading and doomscrolling Instagram reels.
            </p>
            <p>I am from a small coastal city called Gqeberha, so I am very far away from home.  
                However, moving to a new city helped me step outside of my comfrot zone, learn independence and find a routine that works for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the weekends I enjoy taking walks before sunset.  Cat sitting my best friend's cat Lily, and spending time with friends or catching up
                on my favourite series, The Vampire Diaries.  Despite the relaxation I obviously have to find time for studying, planning the next week and working on assignments or 
                studying.
