WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS LAB:
1. I learnt to use correct semantic HTML syntax and file structure despite knowing how to use HTML my structure was quite messy.
2. The correct procedure to merge a branch to main.
3. I learnt how to deploy to GitHub pages for the first time.
4. The importance of semantic HTML and how it affects the layout of your webpage if you do not use it correctly.
